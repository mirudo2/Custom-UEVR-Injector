A simple UEVR injector with some useful features missing from the official injector, such as auto-injection, auto-closing, shortcut creation, and pre-setting variables from the `user_script.txt` file.

- **Auto-Inject**  
  Allows you to load UEVR even in games with weaker anti-cheat systems. Just configure the injector and enable the auto-inject option before starting the game. Use at your own risk—although no bans have been reported so far, there is always a risk depending on the game.

- **Auto-Close**  
  Automatically closes the injector as soon as the injection is complete.
