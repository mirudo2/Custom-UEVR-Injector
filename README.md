How to use?
1. Download the "[UEVR](https://github.com/praydog/UEVR/releases)" mod if you don't have it
2. Download the "[Custom UEVR Injector.exe](https://github.com/mirudo2/Custom-UEVR-Injector/releases)" injector
3. Move "Custom UEVR Injector.exe" to the "UEVR" mod folder
4. Run "Custom UEVR Injector.exe" as administrator
5. Paste the game process name into the console and press ENTER
6. Finally start the game

What does this script do?

1. Check if the game process is running.
2. Get the process directory.
3. Copy the dlls "UEVRBackend.dll" and "openxr_loader.dll" to the process directory.
4. Inject the dll "UEVRBackend.dll".

The difference to the standard "UEVR" injector is that this injector makes the injection automatically and as quickly as possible.
