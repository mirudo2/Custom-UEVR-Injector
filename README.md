
A simple UEVR injector with some useful features missing in the official injector, such as auto-injection, auto-closing, shortcut creation and pre-setting some variables from the user_script.txt file.
- **Auto-Inject** allows you to load UEVR even in some games with weaker anti-cheat systems (just configure the injector and enable the auto inject option before starting the game) - Use at your own risk, although it has never happened yet, there is a risk of banning, depending on the game.
- **Auto-Close** closes the injector as soon as the injection is complete.
